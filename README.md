# ProductiveFlow - A Productivity App
ProductiveFlow assists various professionals with the adequate tools which they require for their tasks, ensuring productivity as well as a easy to use and simple user interface that possesses the required tools. Software developers, graphic designers, and even students use various tools to assist with their daily tasks. Software developers use code editors and/or IDEs to aid in coding productivity. Graphic designers use many graphic designing programs, and students use tools to keep track of their time and make sure that they are productive. 

But what if a software developer needs to design something. What if a graphic designer needs to code something quick, or what if a student needs to do one of the other tasks. They need to download the tools required for those tasks - this takes a lot of time and effort (maybe money) because they need to download and setup the software that they need, and they need to learn how to use this software. This takes a significant amount of time and can critically reduce productivity. 

ProductiveFlow is a the solution to these obstacles, it empowers developers, graphic designers, and students with the tools that they require while still staying productive. ProductiveFlow includes a simple code editor with all of the principal features that aid in productivity when programming. It allows users to create new files, open files, and locally save those files. Furthermore, it includes calendar, to-do list, a stopwatch, and a timer all in one application which is intuitively organized in tabs so the user can access different parts and features of the the application with minimal effort.
